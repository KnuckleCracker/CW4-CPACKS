# CW4-CPACKS

This is a publicly availabe repository for CPACKs (Custom Units and scripts) for Creeper World 4 and for future games that utilize the same method of creating custom units. 

Pleass follow the convention of creating your contributions in a folder that identifies you, and then a sub-folder (optional) for each CPACK. 

It would seem that to use this,either you have to fork the main branch and then submit a pull requst for your branch with the necessary aditions/changes, or you have to submit a request to be added to a lsit of authorised people/teams. Currently the latter is not yet done, so the first methiood seems most direct.
